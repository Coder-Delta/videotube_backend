# Important Notes

## HTTP Request Analogy

Think of an envelope:

- **Envelope** = HTTP Request
- **Address written outside** = URL (e.g., `/api/register`)
- **Notes written inside** = Body

The body is the inside content.

## Node.js Exit Codes

The following is the list of exit codes in Node.js along with their descriptions:

- **Exit Code 0**: Node.js normally ends with a status code of 0 whenever there are no more open async operations and the code doesn't produce any uncaught exceptions.
- **Exit Code 1, Uncaught Fatal Exception**: If an uncaught exception occurs and it is not resolved by a domain or a "uncaughtException" event handler, Node.js exits with an exit code of 1.
- **Exit Code 2**: The exit code 2 is reserved by Bash for abuse of built-in features.
- **Exit Code 3, Internal JavaScript Parse Error**: When internal code cannot be effectively interpreted, this exit code might be utilised in development. This is highly uncommon and often only occurs while Node.js is being developed.
- **Exit Code 4, Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure**: It is also applied in situations where the JavaScript code fails to return the function value during development.
- **Exit Code 5, Fatal Error**: When a fatal, unrecoverable error occurred in V8, this exit code is utilised. Usually, stderr will produce a message with the prefix FATAL ERROR.
- **Exit Code 6, Non-function Internal Exception Handler**: When an internal fatal exception handler function is set to a non-function and unable to be invoked, it is helpful.
- **Exit Code 7, Internal Exception Handler Run-Time Failure**: This error code is used when the internal fatal exception handler code itself issued an error when attempting to handle the uncaught exception. This may occur, for instance, if a `domain.on('error')` handler or a "uncaughtException" returns an error.
- **Exit Code 8**: Exit code 8 in earlier versions of Node.js was sometimes used to denote an uncaught error.
- **Exit Code 9, Invalid Argument**: This is employed when an unspecified option was given or when a value-required option was given without one.
- **Exit Code 10, Internal JavaScript Run-Time Failure**: When the bootstrapping function was invoked, the JavaScript source code internal to Node.js's bootstrapping procedure threw an error.
- **Exit Code 12, Invalid Debug Argument**: The ports specified were either unavailable or invalid, yet the —debug, —inspect, and/or —debug-brk options were set.
- **Exit Code > 128, Signal Exits**: Node.js's exit code is 128 plus the signal code's value if it gets a fatal signal like SIGKILL or SIGHUP. This is a common Unix practice since signal exits set the high-order bit before containing the signal code's value and exit codes are often specified as 7-bit integers.

## Throw Statement

The `throw` statement throws a user-defined exception.

## Libraries and Concepts

### bcrypt
- The `bcrypt` module is written in C++ language, making it 30% faster than `bcryptjs`, which is written in pure JavaScript with no dependencies.

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
- A JWT is a specific type of bearer token.

### Mongoose Hooks
- Mongoose hooks, also known as middleware, are functions that execute before or after specific database operations within the Mongoose library, which is used for interacting with MongoDB in Node.js applications.

### Multer
- The main use of Multer is to handle file uploads from an HTML form that includes a file input field.

## Code Snippet: index.js

You can write the `index.js` file as follows:

```javascript
(async () => {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`); // To connect the .env file, it needs to write process.env
        app.on("error", (error) => {
            console.log(error);
            throw error;
        }); // Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js/node-js-process-complete-reference/

        app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
            console.log(`App is listing on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
        });

    } catch (error) {
        console.error("ERROR: ", error);
        throw error;
    }
})();
```

## User Registration Steps

To register a user:

1. Provide the form.
2. User gives the metadata or payload.
3. Image stores on Cloudinary using POST request.
4. Image deletes using DELETE method.

## JWT Tokens

- **Access Token**: Short time period.
- **Refresh Token**: Long period.

## Indexing

For faster searching, we use indexing. It is a B-tree data structure.

## Aggregation Pipeline Limitations

But toggling itself does not require pipeline, because:

❗ **Aggregation pipeline CANNOT:**

- Delete
- Create
- Insert
- Toggle documents

**Aggregation pipeline is only for:**

- Combining data
- Counting
